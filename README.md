# Solar-Steam-Production
For a number of years I have been interested in producing steam power with a satelite dish and a block of aluminum.
The dish will be covered with a layer of mylar reflective foil, after it is smoothed and coated with an adhesive.
In order to keep the focal point aimed at the heating block, the dish needs to face the sun within a few degrees.  A
simple method to have the dish follow the sun involves using solar panels and two electric motors.  As the panel becomes 
bathed in sunlight, it powers the motor to move the dish to hide it.  I saw this used in a You Tube video made by Night
Hawk.  I want to add to his method using a microcontroller to return the dish to the starting point each morning, reading the 
pressure in the steam line, closing as pressure drops and opening as pressure rises, monitoring a battery charging system that 
powers the everything.

Movement of the dish via the motors is accomplished by reverse direction wiring the motors such that instead of moving to expose
the solar panel, the dish moves to cover the panel.  The arc of movement from east to west is less than 180 degrees. The arc of movement 
from the horizon to the height of the sun is less than 90 degrees.  The carriage for the dish will need to be modified to allow for 
movement.  There will need to be a bearing to allow horizontal movement and a pair of bearings and a shaft for verticle movement.  The 
weight of the dish is a concern.  I will have to address it either by resting it on a spring loaded support or use a lifting spring to 
hold the majority of the weight.
